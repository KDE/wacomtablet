/**
 * @brief An enum of all device types.
 *
 * Device types are tablet components like the stylus, the eraser or the pad itself.
 * This enumeration ensures that only correct device type identifiers are sent via
 * D-Bus by taking care of converting them to a string and providing a way to map
 * these strings back to a device type.
 * <br/>
 * This class also helps to ease maintenance by passing the responsibility for checking
 * for correct device types to the compiler. When using this enumeration it is no
 * longer possible to have method/d-bus calls fail because of typos in the device type
 * identifier. Also refactoring is much easier.
