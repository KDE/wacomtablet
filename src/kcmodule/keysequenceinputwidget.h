/**
 * @class KeySequenceInputWidget
 *
 * @brief A keyboard shortcut input widget similar to KKeySequence.
 *
 * This class is mostly copied from KKeySequence. However this implementation
 * only supports one shortcut and it will not suppress the shift modifier.
 * To set a key sequence on a wacom tablet the full sequence is required. The
 * original KKeySequence implementation suppresses the shift modifier which
 * makes the shortcut useless for xsetwacom.
