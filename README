KDE KCModule

This module implements a GUI for the Wacom Linux Drivers and extends it
with profile support to handle different button / pen layouts per profile.

For hardware support have a look at http://www.linuxwacom.sourceforge.net

Easy profile switching is added via a small plasma applet.
In addition a daemon running in the background helps with hotplug support.

All tablets can be set up as long as they are found with the wacom kernel module.

Check with
$ xsetwacom list devices
if your device is correctly recognized first. If it dosn't show up there, we can't configure it.

Components:
* kded:
	runs in the background, detects a connected tablet and applies the pad button / stylus profile
	detects xrandr rotation and rotates the tablet with it
	apply global shortcuts for the touch on/off stylus feature

* systemsettings module:
	unified gui to set-up the buttons and other aspects of the tablet

* plasma-applet:
	optional applet for easy switching between different profiles

Manual installation
===================

Run-time dependencies:
* X11 wacom tablet driver (xserver-xorg-input-wacom), including the xsetwacom tool, version 0.20 or higher
* libwacom. Highly recommended to have version 0.29 or higher for support of consumer-grade tablets with quirky buttons.

Build dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu:
* g++
* cmake
* extra-cmake-modules
* gettext
* libqt5x11extras5-dev
* qtdeclarative5-dev
* libkf5coreaddons-dev
* libkf5i18n-dev
* libkf5dbusaddons-dev
* libkf5globalaccel-dev
* libkf5config-dev
* libkf5xmlgui-dev
* libkf5notifications-dev
* plasma-framework-dev
* kdoctools-dev
* libxi-dev
* libwacom-dev

You can install them by running:

$ apt install g++ cmake extra-cmake-modules gettext libqt5x11extras5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev libkf5coreaddons-dev libkf5i18n-dev libkf5dbusaddons-dev libkf5globalaccel-dev libkf5config-dev libkf5xmlgui-dev libkf5notifications-dev plasma-framework-dev kdoctools-dev libxi-dev libwacom-dev

Building from source
--------------------

This is *not* a recommended way to use this application. Installing it manually creates files untracked by your pacakge manager.
This can cause everyone problems later on. Please contact your distribution's maintainers to package it instead.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
$ make

Manual installation (this *will* litter in your system):

$ make install

Test KCM component:

$ QT_PLUGIN_PATH=src/kcmodule/ kcmshell5 wacomtablet

Test KDED component:

$ kquitapp5 kded5 && QT_PLUGIN_PATH=src/kded kded5

Run tablet finder:

$ src/tabletfinder/kde_wacom_tabletfinder

Staring the module
==================

Background daemon should be started automatically each time you log in.
If you do not want to restart your session, navigate to System Settings → Startup and Shutdown → Background services and enable "Wacom Tablet" there.
Device settings are located in System Settings → Input Devices → Graphic Tablet

Running unit tests
==================

First, configure the build to include tests by enabling BUILD_TESTING:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
$ make

Then, run the tests with:

$ ctest

or a single one via

$ cd autotests/common/property
$ ./Test.Common.Property

you can find the test results in Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

Add missing tablet devices
==========================

If your device is not recognized by this program, but you can set it up via the xsetwacom driver, run kde_wacom_tabletfinder.

Manually adding missing tablet devices
--------------------------------------

This method shouldn't really be used anymore unless you've encountered problems with kde_wacom_tabletfinder

### Step 1) Get real internal Tablet name ###

xsetwacom list dev

for my Wacom Bamboo:
Wacom Bamboo eraser ERASER
Wacom Bamboo cursor CURSOR
Wacom Bamboo pad PAD
Wacom Bamboo     STYLUS

### Step 2) Then you need the Tablet ID ###

xsetwacom get "Wacom Bamboo" tabletid

for my Wacom Bamboo:
101

### Step 3) Transform it into Hexadecimal ###

For my Wacom Bamboo: 0065

### Step 4) Add a new section into either ~/.config/tabletdblocalrc or the right datafile in /usr/share/wacomtablet/data/ ###

for the Wacom Bamboo the right file is: wacom_devicelist

Add a new entry

for my Wacom Bamboo:

[0065]
model=MTE_450        # try to google for it but not used right now
layout=bl_6          # can be empty if no button layout is available that exists (see images dir)
name=Wacom Bamboo    # name as found above
padbuttons=4         # available buttons on the pad
wheel=no
touchring=yes
touchstripl=no
touchstripr=no
hwbutton1=1          # these mag the physical button numbers to what the XServer likes to name them
hwbutton2=2          # see below for more information
hwbutton3=3
hwbutton4=8

### hwbuttonX explanantion ###

Kernels >= 2.6.38 renamed the buttons for some reason.

xsetwacom does not work with the pysical hardware button numbers 1-X
but rather with the real numbers as seen by the XServer

In case you run into trouble with the buttons do the following:
* deinstall the kded/kcm ;)
* disconnect/reconnect the tablet
* run xev in the terminal
* move the mouse over the new window
* press the hardware buttons and write down what button xev sees

and now update the wacom_device list accordingly

for the new Pen & touch tablets before the kernel 2.6.38 we got
hwbutton1=1
hwbutton2=2
hwbutton3=3
hwbutton4=8

for kernels >= 2.6.38 we get
hwbutton1=3
hwbutton2=8
hwbutton3=9
hwbutton4=1
